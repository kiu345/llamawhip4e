In the context of the Java class [class] provide unit test code for [javaType] declared as [name]. 

Strictly follow all of the following rules:
- Provide the source code of the unit tests JUST for the [javaType] declared as [name]. 
- Keep class imports compact using wildcards 
- Keep all tests separate and independent - single test function per one test scenario
- Use JUnit 5
- When necessary use @BeforeEach, @BeforeAll, @AfterEach, @AfterAll
- When possible use @ParameterizedTest or @RepeatedTest
- Use org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat

In your response return JUST the source code with comments in the following format:

```<language>
<your source code>
``` 

[javaType]=${javaType}

[name]=${name}

[class]=
```${lang}
${documentText}
```
